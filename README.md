# Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Date Created
Created on: [2-2-2025]

## Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Description
This project provides an interactive command-line tool for exploring bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities: **Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.** The program allows users to filter the data by city, month, and day of the week to analyze key statistics related to bikeshare usage.

### Features
- Analyze trip data based on user-specified filters (city, month, day).
- Compute key statistics, including:
  - Most frequent travel times (month, day, and hour).
  - Most popular stations and trip combinations.
  - Total and average trip durations.
  - User statistics (user types, gender distribution, and birth year insights).
- Display raw data in chunks of 5 rows for deeper exploration.

## Files Used
The following files are required for the project:
- chicago.csv – Bikeshare data for Chicago.
- new_york_city.csv – Bikeshare data for New York City.
- washington.csv – Bikeshare data for Washington, D.C.

These CSV files must be in the same directory as the Python script.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- numpy library

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python bikeshare.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a city, month, and day of the week.
3. View the computed statistics based on your selections.
4. Choose whether to display raw data for further analysis.

## Credits
Proper credit is given to:
- Udacity for providing the project structure and dataset.
